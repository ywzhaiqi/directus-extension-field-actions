## ✨ Supports
### 📋 Copy action
Each value can be copied by a custom button. If enabled it's also possible to copy a value by just clickung on it (click-action)

### ➡️ Links
When using the link-option it supports ➡️ HTTP-, 📧 mail-, and 📞 phone- links. Each link can be opened by the custom button. If enabled it's also possible to open the link by just clicking on the value (click-action).

*Note: The extensions currently won't parse invalid links into valid ones!*

### 🖱 Click-Action
Displays and disabled interfaces (== readonly) support a custom click-action. This can be one of:
* default action (does nothing custom)
* Copy-action (copied the value)
* Link-action (openes the link in a new tab)
